# Treasure-Island-Game-Python-
This is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python. It’s a basic interactive game where players make choices to find a treasure.

## How to Play
1. **Start the game**: Run the Python script.
2. **Make choices**: Follow the prompts to choose directions and actions.
3. **Find the treasure**: Choose wisely to win!

## Code
The game is implemented in Python. Here’s a brief overview of the game flow:

- Choose between 'left' or 'right' at a crossroad.
- At the lake, decide to 'wait' for a boat or 'swim' across.
- On the island, choose between a red, yellow, or blue door to find the treasure or face a game over.

## Background
Creating projects can be a great way to learn a programming language. I created this game when I was learning Python. This game helped me understand control flow statements, string methods and boolean logic.
